# Web-Swinging-Physics-Scripts


This is the game physics assignment in which I tried to demonstrate the Web Swinging Physics with the help of Grappling Concept. 
I have also uploaded the scripts which I used in developing the Scene in Unity Engine.

This comes under our syllabus at VIT-Bhopal. 


This is the drive link where I explained the concept of how I demonstrate the Grappling Physics.
